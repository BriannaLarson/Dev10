    <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
      <p>
        I am a recent gradute from the University of Minnesota Class of 2019
        with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and a minor in Spanish Studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently work as an Account Install Specialist for Prime Therapeutics
        in Eagan, MN.
      </p>

    <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
      <p>
        Before landing a job at Prime, I worked as a shift supervisor at
        Starbucks in Eden Prairie, MN.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also very well traveled as I have visited 6 different countries from
        4 different continents, including Germany, Switzerland, Austria, China,
        South Africa, and Cananda.
      </p>

    <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
      <p>
        In addition to traveling, I enjoy baking, movies, and crafting. I am also
        a huge thrill-seeker and animal lover, which is why I exercise a vegetarian
        diet and own an adorable Yorkie named Lexi!
      </p>
      <p>
        In regards to STEM fields, I am by nature a very analytical and logical
        thinker who enjoys problem solving and creating, which is why mathematics
        and computer programming are strong passions of mine.
